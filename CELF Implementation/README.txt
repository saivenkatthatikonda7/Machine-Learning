Execution of the program:

We need to go into the folder 

Command: python FinalProjectscript.py

Information about the project:

1. I was able to plot the Log-Log distribution for the Small World and Scientific Collaboration Networks.
2. The program has executed for the Small World Network and I was able to plot the distribution of all the
three algorithms in a single plot. I printed the Small World Influence Set Size on the console.
3. After executing the small world network successfully, now the program enters into the scientific collabaration network
as it has many lakhs of edges it took so much time for the execution. so to get an idea about how the model i just executed
for 1,2 set of influence node size and plotted the graph for that.
4. after doing it for 1,2 nodes i did it for the other higher numbered nodes but it takes lot of time for that one.
